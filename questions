Suggested queries that should reliably work

Ad-hoc report queries (table output)

Sum of UPB by Portfolio
“Show total CurrentUPBAmt grouped by PortfolioID, sort descending.”

Top instruments by UPB

“List top 25 InstrumentID by CurrentUPBAmt with PortfolioID, GuarantorTypeCode, InstrumentTypeCode.”

Average price + UPB by guarantor

“For each GuarantorTypeCode, show SUM(CurrentUPBAmt) and AVG(TradePrice).”

Factor buckets

Vintage analysis
